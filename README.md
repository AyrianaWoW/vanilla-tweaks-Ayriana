# vanilla-fixes

These are some custom patches for the old 1.12.1 World of Warcraft client, which lacks many of the conveniences of more modern clients.

Current patches:
- Widescreen FoV fix
- Sound in background
- Quickloot reverse patch (hold shift to manual loot)

Usage: pass the path to WoW.exe as a parameter. The patcher creates WoW_patched.exe next to the original binary. Run the game from that exe (or replace the original exe with it, I don't care).
