# turtle-fixes

These are some custom patches for the old World of Warcraft client used by Turtle WoW.
These almost certainly work on the regular 1.12.1 client too, but that is untested.

Current patches:
- Widescreen FoV fix
- Sound in background

Usage: pass the path to WoW.exe as a parameter. The patcher creates WoW_patched.exe next to the original binary. Run the game from that exe (or replace the original exe with it, I don't care).
